This week I moved back to college and my classes have restarted. This week
I worked on a PR to allow infinitely indexed `Range`. See
https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/7741. While doing this PR I discovered
that you cannot monkey patch `object` to assign some attribute. And I want to
mention that Sergey(one of my mentors) is damn good reviewer.
