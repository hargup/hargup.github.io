I spend way too much time on Internet. And in that a lot of time is spend a lot
of reading blogs, news and articles. I've learned a lot of interesting and
sometimes important things this way but I've realized that most of the time I'm
only amusing myself through this stream of information flowing in front of my
eyes. In the spirit of Niel Postman I want to educated not just entertained. So
I've decided for whatever blog or new article I read over the internet I'll
write a two line note about it. I'm hoping that this will slow me down and will
force me to think about the information.
