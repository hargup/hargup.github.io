These are semi public notes on things I read online. Sometime in 2015-2016 I
was writing these notes regularly and then I stopped. I hope to start writing
these notes again sometime. These notes are "semi-public" in the sense that
there is no intended audience for these notes, these notes might might contain
unexaplained context, typos or grammatical mistakes, or something even more
wrong. Read these on your own risk :)
