I was half expecting him to "this is what I've done wrong and I want to fix
it". Unfortunately it was another essay to justify "undeserved" wealth in the
hands of startup founders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul's essay fails to look at the dynamics of power and money. The amount of
money someone has is often a proxy for political power in the hand of someone.
Increasing inequality amounts to increasing disbalance in political power.
Concentration of political power is problematic because the powerful influence
things in their in their favor knowingly or unknowlingly ignoring the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue that Paul fails to address is the reason for economic inequality.
The wealth of someone grows exponentially, the money someone has the easier it
will be for them to make even more money. That has nothing to do with how much
"deserving" they are or how much wealth they have. Sure your startups have
helped the world, but that doesn't mean they "deserve" all the wealth they
have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have answer to the problem of inequality, but this doesn't mean the
problem doesn't exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>webnotes</category><guid>http://hargup.in/webnotes/economic_inequality.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jul 2016 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Why isn't the NSA a hot topic in the US elections?</title><link>http://hargup.in/webnotes/why_isnt_nsa_a_hot_topic_in_us_elections.html</link><dc:creator>Harsh Gupta</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;The article talks about how NSA surveillance should be one of the topics of the
US presidential election but isn't. It compares the situation with Germany
where the population is very privacy conscious. It brings out important facts
but doesn't connect them well, it says that German population is privacy
conscious because of the human rights violation by Eastern Block Germany and
earlier by the Nazi secret police, but it reaches the conclusion that
surveillance isn't a hot topic because it is very nuanced and doesn't make good
catch phrase. But every topic is nuanced if you look deep enough and every
issue has only one answer on the surface. Politicians don't generally aim to
change the norm during the election but rather try to attract a sect of people
who already agrees with her/him. So the question here should be why does the
German population care and US doesn't. Well one of the answers can be history
as the author already mentioned, there have been thought policing in the
McCarthy era too but not sure about the extent to which it affected the white
population. Another important factor should be the corporate influence in
politics and maybe media in America compared to Germany. Corporate surveillance
goes hand in hand in government surveillance, if corporates doesn't support an
issue the issue remains unattractive for the politicians. Also it would be an
interesting exercise to study the relation between the profits a parent company
make through breaches of privacy and its coverage on surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>webnotes</category><guid>http://hargup.in/webnotes/why_isnt_nsa_a_hot_topic_in_us_elections.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Apr 2016 15:15:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>lessons_from_brain_scans</title><link>http://hargup.in/webnotes/lessons_from_brain_scans.html</link><dc:creator>Harsh Gupta</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPECT Scans&lt;/p&gt;

normalized. The answer is a weird combinatin of over optimism, rationalization
and adaption. And when a messed up practice gets normalized it is very hard to
see what's wrong with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very simply solution that Atul Gawande talked about in the Checklist
Manifesto is to have a checklist. In the book he compared the medical sector
and infrastucture/construction sector. Both fields are immensely complex but
medicial practitioners often end up making terrible mistakes, which includes
cases like the one where a surgen forgot her equipment in the patient, where as
in construction error which have any harm to human life are very very rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you don't have checklist for every small thing, and Atul provided a
guideline to making checklist, I don't clearly remember and I should go and
read the sections of the book again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checklists are useful because they end up freeing your mind from the
unnecessary boring detail. there are also other cases I can think of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where to apply a rule:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the rewards or looses of doing something occur only in long term, we
tend to ignore the long term result and focus on instant gratification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always and never rules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The projects the complete counts and not the one you start.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formalization leads to gramatization, when a formal structure is in place it is
harder see things in informal terms or whatever that doesn't fall into that
formal structure tends to get ignored. A very clear example will be case where
peolple who have only learned about information transfer uses of language tend
find phatic usuages like that of small talk "useless".  But as it evident from
the use of term phatic, the way we with problems of formalization is more
formalization trying to capture things which weren't captured earlier, ofcourse
that formalization also leaves something. But as it said in Statistics, all
models are false but some are useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>webnotes</category><guid>http://hargup.in/webnotes/normailization_of_deviation.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2015 18:46:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>You're only 23 stop rushing life</title><link>http://hargup.in/webnotes/you_re_only_23.html</link><dc:creator>Harsh Gupta</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;We are young, energetic and ambitious but impatient. We want to "successful",
fast. Success is defined relative to the "success" of our peers which gives a
feeling that if we are not rushing things we are "falling behind". In our
definition success is a race. When you are running a race you can't stop to see
if this race is something worth running for. In the "race of life" everybody is
a looser. I think I can also say "in any race of life everybody is a looser".&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>webnotes</category><guid>http://hargup.in/webnotes/you_re_only_23.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 12 Dec 2015 19:49:19 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Let's not let fear defeat our Values</title><link>http://hargup.in/webnotes/let_fear_not_defeat_our_values.html</link><dc:creator>Harsh Gupta</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently American Presidential candidate Donal Trump called out for a total ban on Muslim immigration to America. It is great to see that Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, come out and speak against it. I totally support his statement that people like him, people who are privileged should speak up for people who are not so privileged because whose voices are often not included in the debate.&lt;/p&gt;

Why am I still doing programming? Because
the programming I do is easy and it gets paid well and it is very uncomfortable
to move to newer areas, especially because they involve a lot of uncertaintly.
But do I want to do programming for life? Programming is great and powerful
tool but programming as end of things is not something that I want. I can learn
the new skills with time, I guess this time it is important that I don't take
pure programming jobs, or else it will become harder and harded to come out of
comfort zone. Take computational social science or ethics or civics intern and
more policy and social issue and please keep writing and share your writings.
You'll be misrepresented/misunderstood a few times, but its okay thats the way
you'll learn.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>webnotes</category><guid>http://hargup.in/webnotes/a_non_programmers_apology.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2015 20:56:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Surprising Problem of Too Much Talent</title><link>http://hargup.in/webnotes/too_much_talent.html</link><dc:creator>Harsh Gupta</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;The study from some sports suggests that add more talented people decreases the
overall team performance probably due to decreased coversion in the team. I
guess the problem is more because of hiring assholes rather than hiring talent.
People skills and physical/sports/domain ability often don't come together.
And as suggested by _&amp;lt;stegasourous strategy&amp;gt;, in some areas assholery appears
more clever (say talented).&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>webnotes</category><guid>http://hargup.in/webnotes/too_much_talent.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2015 10:42:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The problem with Female SuperHeros</title><link>http://hargup.in/webnotes/problem_with_female_superheroes.html</link><dc:creator>Harsh Gupta</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;The article summarized a research which found that exposure to a 13 minute clip
featuring the Damsel in distress trop reduced the gender egalitarian views of
the participant and exposure of hypersexualized female characters reduced their
body esteem. To me the results were not unexpected. The comments thread wasn't
unexpected either. A lot of people were saying why there are studying the
effect on only women and not on men. Others were saying men are sexualized too.
Both are valid propositions if they are poposed as extension of research but
totally unvalid in the context because they were used to discredit the
research. Just because men suffer doesn't mean the sufferings of men and women
are equal and the problems of women are not worth the attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>webnotes</category><guid>http://hargup.in/webnotes/problem_with_female_superheroes.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2015 10:24:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>How not to counter Modimania</title><link>http://hargup.in/webnotes/how_not_to_counter_modimania.html</link><dc:creator>Harsh Gupta</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago our prime minister Narendra Modi visited UK and a he was "not
welcomed" there, at least by some of the people. An image of Modi with a sword
in one hand and Om in background convering to Swastika symbolized that Modi is
equivalent to Hitler. The author aptly said that such method to counter Hindu
communalism aren't only outright offensive but also counter productive. The
point is to attack Hindu Communalism not to attack Hindus. Author suggested
that a better approach will be trying to evoke the spirit of tolerance and
inclusiveness found in Vedic Hindism.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>webnotes</category><guid>http://hargup.in/webnotes/how_not_to_counter_modimania.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Nov 2015 13:28:50 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
