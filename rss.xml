often they are designed for the "average" and people who are not in the
"average" are left out. Here the "average" often means the elite or people who
are already in power and control things. There have numerous cases of implicit
sexism and racisim "by technology" [1] [2]. When designing technology we need
to careful of whom we include but also who we exclude.&lt;/p&gt;

distracted. He gave two to three arguments which really didn't fit in. He first
told media and scientist are blaming the new technology which keeps us so
distracted. It is the internet and the computers now, in 80s people blamed the
distraction on TVs and 40 on radios and even earlier on movies. And the classic
example where Socrates said that writing will bring forgetfulness in people's
sole. I keep hearing this argument all the time and it is often used to say
"You older generation you have always feared the new technology will bring
distraction and have always been wrong and you are also wrong this time". This
is sometime also accompanied by a picture of a lot of people reading newspaper in
a bus and no one talking to one another. This argument I feel is very shallow,
just because transition from one technology to another didn't causes people to
become more "distracted" doesn't mean this upcoming transition won't or isn't
doing the same. There is also an implicit assumption that the earlier
transition didn't bring more "distraction" and as I said a belief the older
generation is seeing the whole technology as bad. I like to see things the way
Walter O. Jong described in his book Orality and Literacy, that Literacy didn't
just "upgraded" orality, it completely changed who we are, we gained a lot but
we also lost somethings and literacy even changed the definition of what we
consider as gain and what as loss. I sincerely believe that internet is one
awesome invention by humans but there are things we need to fix about it, soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well in the beginning of the essay Adam talked about Mozzart and his amazing
concentration. I don't see how it made sense. He took a single example out of
time and context and just threw it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the essay he talked about the role of hyperlinks in
distraction, every hyperlink is a decision, to click or not click. Often when
on the internet you just keep browsing through the hyperlinks, one link to the
another, forgetting where you came from and why. I enjoy doing it and sometimes
I stumble upon very interesting content this way but of course this is not a
good to get things done, and to learn something deeply and thoroughly. And I
think I should do this random browsing less often, but it is not something evil
that I should not do at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end he pointed out that many of the internet companies makes their
profit from advertisements and it makes sense for them to keep us distracted,
because the more pages we visit the more ads we see, a distracted person will
visit more pages in unit time so more profit made. A more distracted population
also makes sense for totalitarian governments and big cooperates because a more
distracted population is less likely to notice their autocracies and is less
likely to protest. A distracted population is a population which is easier to
control. By the way a very problematic aspect of online advertisement is cross
website tracking and surveillance. We seriously need to take a stand against
it. If you have not done it already I highly recommend that you watch the
interactive documentary "Do Not Track Us" &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://donottrack-doc.com/en/"&gt;https://donottrack-doc.com/en/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://hargup.in/webnotes/the_real_reason_why_you_are_distracted.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 14 Nov 2015 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Let the other 95% Of Reality In</title><link>http://hargup.in/webnotes/let_the_other_95_percent_in.html</link><dc:creator>Harsh Gupta</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a rebuttal of Paul Graham's essay "Let the 95% in", where PG argues to
easing the immigration laws so that tech companies can get more programmers
from outside the US. Tough I and also the author sympathesis with the
conclusion, PG has got all the arguments wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first read PG's essay I liked it and I was "yup, this guy is making
sense" and now he doesn't. This tells me that I need to think more carefully
about the things I read and thing which forms my opinion. And need to include
more opposing sources of information in my reading. Its like when I first read
PG many years ago I liked him and then I read a lot of him and I felt
everything he writes is so true. Which is almost impossible for anyone? Well
why do I think so? Okay, no meta thoughts for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://hargup.in/webnotes/let_the_other_95_percent_in.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 14 Nov 2015 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Inconsistency with Discrepency</title><link>http://hargup.in/webnotes/inconsitency_without_discrepency.html</link><dc:creator>Harsh Gupta</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article shared an interesting and a very positive perspective on Nehru,
the first Prime Minister of India. He was inconsistent without disagreement. Our
present government says it is pro development, against development nothing
matter and especially secularism should go to the dump. Nehru was a person who
things as a whole, he recognized that scientific and industrial development is
important to gain power but he also understood these are not the only thing we
need to have. Our people need to have a depth of personality and sense of
tolerance to see that they are not the only people who are right. Nehru was
against dogma, including the dogma of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a post where Nehru was being criticized for his Hindu rate of growth and
that was the only thing mentioned about him. But other factors about Nehru
often gets ignore, the time when Nehru took the lead of the Nation, it was in a
utter state of Chaos. India is a country where people can be divided in
thousands of different groups, be it by caste, religion or language. The fact
that he managed to keep the Nation One I think is an achievement in itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://hargup.in/webnotes/inconsitency_without_discrepency.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 14 Nov 2015 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Academic Assholes and the circle of niceness</title><link>http://hargup.in/webnotes/academic_assholes_and_the_circle_of_niceness.html</link><dc:creator>Harsh Gupta</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Academia has a problem of Assholes, people who belittle other people, bash for
not knowing something etc. In this article the author discuss what promotes
people to behave as assholes. She talks about the book ‘The No Asshole Rule’
Robert Sutton, where he discuss why having a asshole in your organization is
bad and in the last chapter he tries to answer the question "Is there any
advantage of being an asshole?", it turns out that unkind behavior is seen as
unlikeable but is seen as more clever and intelligent and this is what promotes
assholes in Academia. I want to Sutton's book, it appears to be a very
interesting read, I also skimmed through his blog a few days and he appeared
insightful.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>http://hargup.in/webnotes/academic_assholes_and_the_circle_of_niceness.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Nov 2015 11:40:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The stegosaurus strategy</title><link>http://hargup.in/webnotes/the_stegosaurus_strategy.html</link><dc:creator>Harsh Gupta</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Academicians by their nature and training are critical, they are skeptic and
they are trained to see where things might go wrong. What can be faulty
assumption and what step doesn't really follow from the previous one. Facing
and embracing your criticism is important as it brings out hidden flaws and
helps you improve overall. This can be tough for people who are new to it. It
was touch for the author of this blog post, they have decried the events where
they have cried in the bathroom and though about quitting academia on their
forth day. But people eventually cope up with criticism and author describes
mainly two strategies people take. Some people internalize what critiques like
and what they don't and they do the things which they like and avoid the one
which they don't. They basically become a chameleon. Others develop a hard skin
and become stegosaurus. Stegosaurus spin their tail and argues back. Author
argues you should become neither of them, chameleon does things for the fear
and not for the love of it whereas stegosaurus in some sense becomes the bully
themselves. What will I do? I don't know a stegosaurus definitely seems better
than a chameleon&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>http://hargup.in/webnotes/the_stegosaurus_strategy.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Nov 2015 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Giving with No Thought of Return</title><link>http://hargup.in/webnotes/giving_with_no_thought_of_return.html</link><dc:creator>Harsh Gupta</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steven Holden a PSF board member writes about the question which industry often
asks "What's in for Me?" when it comes to contributing to Open Source. And he
tries to argue that this should be a question at all because money shouldn't be
only thing that matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years I have also developed deep skepticism and kinda disgust for the
big corporate and their mentality that profit justifies everything. And the
sadder part is that a lot of commoners have also justfied this idea. This
argument of "it sells" comes from everything from sexism in video games and
advertising to privacy issues and the copyright laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundereds of startups are booming up from Scilicon Valley to Bangalore it would
be interesting to analyze how many of them wouldn't even have the scope of
coming up if they didn't have all these open source tools and languages. Open
Source has given them so much yet they ask "What's in for me?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://hargup.in/webnotes/giving_with_no_thought_of_return.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Nov 2015 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>When Women Stopped Coding</title><link>http://hargup.in/webnotes/when_women_stopped_coding.html</link><dc:creator>Harsh Gupta</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;In 1970's the number of women was low(10-15%) in every field, be in law,
medicine, computer science and physical sciences. The numbers have been
increasing steadily till date except for computer science, till 85 it was was
something around 30% and then it started decreasing. Now computer science has
less than 20% women and whereas other field have achieved near perfect gender
equality in terms of percentage of women enrolled. What went wrong? According
to the author, 80s saw a release of series of SciFi movies with a geeky male
protaganist. At that time computers were only toys and they bought only for
boys. We got our norm, men are geeky women are not and there by we got the
diversity problem in tech.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>http://hargup.in/webnotes/when_women_stopped_coding.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Nov 2015 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Two Years without Facebook</title><link>http://hargup.in/webnotes/two_years_without_facebook.html</link><dc:creator>Harsh Gupta</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon this blog post by Guru Prasad, where he describes spending two
years without Facebook. He did it for privacy reasons and because Facebook is
collecting way too much information than they should. He is also annoyed by the
fact that Facebook is not as much a medium to stay in touch but a stream of
photos and shares choosen by the algorithm of Facebook often to sell you
targeted ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also tried such experiment last to last year, but that for two weeks not two
years. And no one will care if you are there or not, most of the people won't
even notice your absence. I also hate the fact that facebook track your every
mouse gesture your every moment you spend on their website. I definitely don't
mean to say that social media is evil phenomenon but that doesn't mean
everything is good about them and I want to take the bad parts out. For the
similar privacy/power balance reasons I want to move away from Google services.
I already use DuckDuckGo for search and I've also diched Google Chrome for
firefox. I'll try to spend some time this winter finding alternatives to gmail
and how I can move away from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not diching Facebook yet, but I guess I can partially mitigate its bad
parts. One of to do it would probably be using a command line client for
facebook in which I choose who's posts and shares I subscribe to. I don't know
if anyone has done it yet, but I think that should be possible given the api by
facebook. Maybe I can also use elinks?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://hargup.in/webnotes/two_years_without_facebook.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Nov 2015 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>This Brilliant Comic Strip On Rich Vs Poor Upbringing Will Humble You</title><link>http://hargup.in/webnotes/rich_vs_poor_upbringing.html</link><dc:creator>Harsh Gupta</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;The author two children one had rich parents and other had poor parents, for
