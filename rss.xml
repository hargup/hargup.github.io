I was half expecting him to "this is what I've done wrong and I want to fix
it". Unfortunately it was another essay to justify "undeserved" wealth in the
hands of startup founders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul's essay fails to look at the dynamics of power and money. The amount of
money someone has is often a proxy for political power in the hand of someone.
Increasing inequality amounts to increasing disbalance in political power.
Concentration of political power is problematic because the powerful influence
things in their in their favor knowingly or unknowlingly ignoring the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue that Paul fails to address is the reason for economic inequality.
The wealth of someone grows exponentially, the money someone has the easier it
will be for them to make even more money. That has nothing to do with how much
"deserving" they are or how much wealth they have. Sure your startups have
helped the world, but that doesn't mean they "deserve" all the wealth they
have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have answer to the problem of inequality, but this doesn't mean the
problem doesn't exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>webnotes</category><guid>http://hargup.in/webnotes/economic_inequality.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2016 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>digital_activism</title><link>http://hargup.in/webnotes/digital_activism.html</link><dc:creator>Harsh Gupta</dc:creator><description>&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promote Free Software, Free as in Free Speech, rather mandate their use in
such cases. Even Free Software can also be biased but in case of non free
software it can become practically impossible to find their biases and
correct them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We as should selling algorithms as magic, instead of saying there is 60
likelihood that person X will commit the crime again, say according to my
system the person X is sixty percent similar to other people who commit the
crime again with my rather transparent definition of similarity. Ram and
Rahim are brother, as brothers of course they are similar at many levels,
Ram has commited a crime does that mean Rahim will do it too?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://hargup.in/webnotes/machine_bias.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 26 May 2016 19:45:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Why isn't the NSA a hot topic in the US elections?</title><link>http://hargup.in/webnotes/why_isnt_nsa_a_hot_topic_in_us_elections.html</link><dc:creator>Harsh Gupta</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;The article talks about how NSA surveillance should be one of the topics of the
US presidential election but isn't. It compares the situation with Germany
where the population is very privacy conscious. It brings out important facts
but doesn't connect them well, it says that German population is privacy
conscious because of the human rights violation by Eastern Block Germany and
earlier by the Nazi secret police, but it reaches the conclusion that
surveillance isn't a hot topic because it is very nuanced and doesn't make good
catch phrase. But every topic is nuanced if you look deep enough and every
issue has only one answer on the surface. Politicians don't generally aim to
change the norm during the election but rather try to attract a sect of people
who already agrees with her/him. So the question here should be why does the
German population care and US doesn't. Well one of the answers can be history
as the author already mentioned, there have been thought policing in the
McCarthy era too but not sure about the extent to which it affected the white
population. Another important factor should be the corporate influence in
politics and maybe media in America compared to Germany. Corporate surveillance
goes hand in hand in government surveillance, if corporates doesn't support an
issue the issue remains unattractive for the politicians. Also it would be an
interesting exercise to study the relation between the profits a parent company
make through breaches of privacy and its coverage on surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>webnotes</category><guid>http://hargup.in/webnotes/why_isnt_nsa_a_hot_topic_in_us_elections.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Apr 2016 15:15:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>lessons_from_brain_scans</title><link>http://hargup.in/webnotes/lessons_from_brain_scans.html</link><dc:creator>Harsh Gupta</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPECT Scans&lt;/p&gt;

normalized. The answer is a weird combinatin of over optimism, rationalization
and adaption. And when a messed up practice gets normalized it is very hard to
see what's wrong with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very simply solution that Atul Gawande talked about in the Checklist
Manifesto is to have a checklist. In the book he compared the medical sector
and infrastucture/construction sector. Both fields are immensely complex but
medicial practitioners often end up making terrible mistakes, which includes
cases like the one where a surgen forgot her equipment in the patient, where as
in construction error which have any harm to human life are very very rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you don't have checklist for every small thing, and Atul provided a
guideline to making checklist, I don't clearly remember and I should go and
read the sections of the book again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checklists are useful because they end up freeing your mind from the
unnecessary boring detail. there are also other cases I can think of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where to apply a rule:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the rewards or looses of doing something occur only in long term, we
tend to ignore the long term result and focus on instant gratification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always and never rules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The projects the complete counts and not the one you start.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formalization leads to gramatization, when a formal structure is in place it is
harder see things in informal terms or whatever that doesn't fall into that
formal structure tends to get ignored. A very clear example will be case where
peolple who have only learned about information transfer uses of language tend
find phatic usuages like that of small talk "useless".  But as it evident from
the use of term phatic, the way we with problems of formalization is more
formalization trying to capture things which weren't captured earlier, ofcourse
that formalization also leaves something. But as it said in Statistics, all
models are false but some are useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>webnotes</category><guid>http://hargup.in/webnotes/normailization_of_deviation.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2015 18:46:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>You're only 23 stop rushing life</title><link>http://hargup.in/webnotes/you_re_only_23.html</link><dc:creator>Harsh Gupta</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;We are young, energetic and ambitious but impatient. We want to "successful",
fast. Success is defined relative to the "success" of our peers which gives a
feeling that if we are not rushing things we are "falling behind". In our
definition success is a race. When you are running a race you can't stop to see
if this race is something worth running for. In the "race of life" everybody is
a looser. I think I can also say "in any race of life everybody is a looser".&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>webnotes</category><guid>http://hargup.in/webnotes/you_re_only_23.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 12 Dec 2015 19:49:19 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
