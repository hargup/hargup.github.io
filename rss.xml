welcomed" there, at least by some of the people. An image of Modi with a sword
in one hand and Om in background convering to Swastika symbolized that Modi is
equivalent to Hitler. The author aptly said that such method to counter Hindu
communalism aren't only outright offensive but also counter productive. The
point is to attack Hindu Communalism not to attack Hindus. Author suggested
that a better approach will be trying to evoke the spirit of tolerance and
inclusiveness found in Vedic Hindism.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>http://hargup.in/webnotes/how_not_to_counter_modimania.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Nov 2015 13:28:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>surveillance_bill</title><link>http://hargup.in/webnotes/surveillance_bill.html</link><dc:creator>Harsh Gupta</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK Government is trying to push a which will force internet and phone companies
to store the all the data for 12 months. Indian government also pushed a draft
of similar encryption policy a few months where everyone was required to store
the plaintext of all the encryptions for 90 days. Probably UK and US government
have laws where I can be arrested for being a terrorist "sympathizer" and I
also heard a statement from David Cameroon that he wants to curb "non violent
extremists". Tell me how is being a "extremist" here. Governments are simply
creating Fear, Uncertainly and Doubt to control more and more aspects of our
lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm hundred, maybe even thousand time more likely to die in a car crash than in
a attack like that of Paris of Mumbai. Which party has its agenda, "we need to
make safer cars", "we need to stop rash driving", "we need to force companies
to make such a cars that can never kill anybody."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://hargup.in/webnotes/surveillance_bill.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2015 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Mathematical alchemy and wrestling</title><link>http://hargup.in/webnotes/mathematical_alchemy_and_wrestling.html</link><dc:creator>Harsh Gupta</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I'm an Alchemist!&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>http://hargup.in/webnotes/mathematical_alchemy_and_wrestling.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2015 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>K'Naan of censoring himself for Success</title><link>http://hargup.in/webnotes/k_naan_censoring_myself_for_sucess.html</link><dc:creator>Harsh Gupta</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;K'Naan is amazing, I learned about him, when everybody learned about him during
the 2010 FIFA world cup. A remix of his Wavin' Flag was selected as the theme
song for the world cup. It was happy, fun and energetic song but when I
listened to the original version of the song I was awestruck, the song tells a
powerful story of people of Somalia and their struggle, the remix had nothing
of it. The two talks about totally different freedoms, one is "freedom and
fire" to rock the football field other is the freedom to live. I was discussing
this with a friend last night and listened more of his older songs and newer
songs. The older songs were deep and very personal telling one or the other
tales of the civil wars and its autocracies. Newer songs were much more
Americanized and in a sense they lacked substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was happy to see that K'naan himself recognized this fact and wrote about it.
He writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over breakfast in SoHo, we talked about how to keep my new American audience
growing. My lyrics should change, my label’s executives said; radio
programmers avoid subjects too far from fun and self-absorption.
And for the first time, I felt the affliction of success. When I walked away
from the table, there were bruises on the unheard lyrics of my yet-to-be-born
songs. A question had raised its hand in the quiet of my soul: What do you do
after success? What must you do to keep it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this was censorship, I thought, it was a new kind — one I had to do to
myself. The label wasn’t telling me what to do. No, it was just giving me
choices and information, about my audience — 15-year-old American girls,
mostly, who knew little of Somalia. How much better to sing them songs about
Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://hargup.in/webnotes/k_naan_censoring_myself_for_sucess.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2015 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>cross_device_tracking_using_ultrasonic</title><link>http://hargup.in/webnotes/cross_device_tracking_using_ultrasonic.html</link><dc:creator>Harsh Gupta</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Coorporates can now track you across devices.

providing for providing money to Free and Open Source Software. The whole world
is reaping a lot of benefit from FOSS and there are people who have become
billionair on the leveling ground created by FOSS but unfortunately very few of
those fruit come back to the FOSS developers and communities in terms of
resources and money which is absolutely necessary for long term sustainance of
any project be it software or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the very important distinction Russell made was that of Use Value and
Sale Value. Use Value of something is the measure of "usefulness" of something
and sale value is how much you can sell it for. When you feel the sale value of
something justifies the use value of something, you buy it, say a nice coffee
mug you saw at a local store. When the coustomer is another business it is
easier to compare the use value and the sale value. Business operates on things
which can be sold but a whole lot of things have use value but not a sale
value. Research can be great example for it, people can buy the end product of
research, i.e., a new technology a new idea and a new perspective but you
cannot buy reseach. Research is a process for every tangible/sellable result
there are thousand results which are not sellable. [#1] Infrastructure is also
an example. The use value of roads is very high but there will be very few
who'll be able to pay for the construction of roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joint Grants&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Summer of Code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fellowship&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of creating new idea and it brings
about concepts which couldn't have . Buying the end product doesn't&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should I buy grade A steel
or grade B steel, whicher makes me more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we shouldn't try to measure everything in terms of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as you understand not&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[#1]: One can say that one model of research can be a winner take all strategy,
let a lot of researchers work on a problem and when someone arives at the
solution give the winner a huge reward. This has two problems, first is the
typical lifetime of research projects are very long it will very difficult for
researchers to support themselves without external support. Even the "results"
of a research can extend over generation. A second problem is that it will
change the incentive structure of research and give more priority to low
hanging short term projects.&lt;/p&gt;

happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.) The Europe is wildly unaccepting of Muslim population, often pass laws
which disrupts their lifestyle and see them as outsides even though they have
been living in there from two to three generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.) Wild unemployment and lack of food security in Middle East which can be
linked directly to Climate Change and Global Warming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://hargup.in/webnotes/level_headed_syria.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2015 08:29:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The real reason why you are distracted</title><link>http://hargup.in/webnotes/the_real_reason_why_you_are_distracted.html</link><dc:creator>Harsh Gupta</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this video essay Adam Westbrook tries to reason out why our generation so
distracted. He gave two to three arguments which really didn't fit in. He first
told media and scientist are blaming the new technology which keeps us so
distracted. It is the internet and the computers now, in 80s people blamed the
distraction on TVs and 40 on radios and even earlier on movies. And the classic
example where Socrates said that writing will bring forgetfulness in people's
sole. I keep hearing this argument all the time and it is often used to say
"You older generation you have always feared the new technology will bring
distraction and have always been wrong and you are also wrong this time". This
is sometime also accompanied by a picture of a lot of people reading newspaper in
a bus and no one talking to one another. This argument I feel is very shallow,
just because transition from one technology to another didn't causes people to
become more "distracted" doesn't mean this upcoming transition won't or isn't
doing the same. There is also an implicit assumption that the earlier
transition didn't bring more "distraction" and as I said a belief the older
generation is seeing the whole technology as bad. I like to see things the way
Walter O. Jong described in his book Orality and Literacy, that Literacy didn't
just "upgraded" orality, it completely changed who we are, we gained a lot but
we also lost somethings and literacy even changed the definition of what we
consider as gain and what as loss. I sincerely believe that internet is one
awesome invention by humans but there are things we need to fix about it, soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well in the beginning of the essay Adam talked about Mozzart and his amazing
concentration. I don't see how it made sense. He took a single example out of
time and context and just threw it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the essay he talked about the role of hyperlinks in
distraction, every hyperlink is a decision, to click or not click. Often when
on the internet you just keep browsing through the hyperlinks, one link to the
another, forgetting where you came from and why. I enjoy doing it and sometimes
I stumble upon very interesting content this way but of course this is not a
good to get things done, and to learn something deeply and thoroughly. And I
think I should do this random browsing less often, but it is not something evil
that I should not do at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end he pointed out that many of the internet companies makes their
profit from advertisements and it makes sense for them to keep us distracted,
because the more pages we visit the more ads we see, a distracted person will
visit more pages in unit time so more profit made. A more distracted population
also makes sense for totalitarian governments and big cooperates because a more
distracted population is less likely to notice their autocracies and is less
likely to protest. A distracted population is a population which is easier to
control. By the way a very problematic aspect of online advertisement is cross
website tracking and surveillance. We seriously need to take a stand against
it. If you have not done it already I highly recommend that you watch the
interactive documentary "Do Not Track Us" &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://donottrack-doc.com/en/"&gt;https://donottrack-doc.com/en/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://hargup.in/webnotes/the_real_reason_why_you_are_distracted.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Nov 2015 14:45:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Inconsistency with Discrepency</title><link>http://hargup.in/webnotes/inconsitency_without_discrepency.html</link><dc:creator>Harsh Gupta</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article shared an interesting and a very positive perspective on Nehru,
the first Prime Minister of India. He was inconsistent without disagreement. Our
present government says it is pro development, against development nothing
matter and especially secularism should go to the dump. Nehru was a person who
things as a whole, he recognized that scientific and industrial development is
important to gain power but he also understood these are not the only thing we
need to have. Our people need to have a depth of personality and sense of
tolerance to see that they are not the only people who are right. Nehru was
against dogma, including the dogma of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a post where Nehru was being criticized for his Hindu rate of growth and
that was the only thing mentioned about him. But other factors about Nehru
often gets ignore, the time when Nehru took the lead of the Nation, it was in a
utter state of Chaos. India is a country where people can be divided in
thousands of different groups, be it by caste, religion or language. The fact
that he managed to keep the Nation One I think is an achievement in itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://hargup.in/webnotes/inconsitency_without_discrepency.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Nov 2015 06:55:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>You don't want to be an edge case</title><link>http://hargup.in/webnotes/you_don_t_want_to_an_edge_case.html</link><dc:creator>Harsh Gupta</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are relying more and more on algorithms for making decisions for us but
often they are designed for the "average" and people who are not in the
"average" are left out. Here the "average" often means the elite or people who
are already in power and control things. There have numerous cases of implicit
sexism and racisim "by technology" [1] [2]. When designing technology we need
to careful of whom we include but also who we exclude.&lt;/p&gt;
