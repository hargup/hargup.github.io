The GSoC is about to end. We have the suggested deadline tomorrow and the firm
deadline next week. We are wrapping up the project now, cleaning up the code,
writing the documentation and turning the project into a usable state.
Since the new solvers cannot be called compelete I have to make sure that the
next person working on it can pick it up easily. I plan come up with a post with
the summary of the work that was done, that challenges we faced and thing that
needs to done and how can they be tackled.
