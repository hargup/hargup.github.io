.. title: A Non-Programmerâ€™s Apology
.. date: Thursday 10 December 2015 02:26:18 AM IST

I pretty much agree with Aaron here. Why am I still doing programming? Because
the programming I do is easy and it gets paid well and it is very uncomfortable
to move to newer areas, especially because they involve a lot of uncertaintly.
But do I want to do programming for life? Programming is great and powerful
tool but programming as end of things is not something that I want. I can learn
the new skills with time, I guess this time it is important that I don't take
pure programming jobs, or else it will become harder and harded to come out of
comfort zone. Take computational social science or ethics or civics intern and
more policy and social issue and please keep writing and share your writings.
You'll be misrepresented/misunderstood a few times, but its okay thats the way
you'll learn.
