The article summarized a research which found that exposure to a 13 minute clip
featuring the Damsel in distress trop reduced the gender egalitarian views of
the participant and exposure of hypersexualized female characters reduced their
body esteem. To me the results were not unexpected. The comments thread wasn't
unexpected either. A lot of people were saying why there are studying the
effect on only women and not on men. Others were saying men are sexualized too.
Both are valid propositions if they are poposed as extension of research but
totally unvalid in the context because they were used to discredit the
research. Just because men suffer doesn't mean the sufferings of men and women
are equal and the problems of women are not worth the attention.
