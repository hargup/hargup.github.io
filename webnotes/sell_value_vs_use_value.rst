In a talk at PyCon Australia Russell Keith-Magee talks about the need to
providing for providing money to Free and Open Source Software. The whole world
is reaping a lot of benefit from FOSS and there are people who have become
billionair on the leveling ground created by FOSS but unfortunately very few of
those fruit come back to the FOSS developers and communities in terms of
resources and money which is absolutely necessary for long term sustainance of
any project be it software or otherwise.

One of the very important distinction Russell made was that of Use Value and
Sale Value. Use Value of something is the measure of "usefulness" of something
and sale value is how much you can sell it for. When you feel the sale value of
something justifies the use value of something, you buy it, say a nice coffee
mug you saw at a local store. When the coustomer is another business it is
easier to compare the use value and the sale value. Business operates on things
which can be sold but a whole lot of things have use value but not a sale
value. Research can be great example for it, people can buy the end product of
research, i.e., a new technology a new idea and a new perspective but you
cannot buy reseach. Research is a process for every tangible/sellable result
there are thousand results which are not sellable. [#1] Infrastructure is also
an example. The use value of roads is very high but there will be very few
who'll be able to pay for the construction of roads.

Should I buy grade A steel
or grade B steel, whicher makes me more money.

But we shouldn't try to measure everything in terms of money.

But as you understand not 

[#1]: One can say that one model of research can be a winner take all strategy,
let a lot of researchers work on a problem and when someone arives at the
solution give the winner a huge reward. This has two problems, first is the
typical lifetime of research projects are very long it will very difficult for
researchers to support themselves without external support. Even the "results"
of a research can extend over generation. A second problem is that it will
change the incentive structure of research and give more priority to low
hanging short term projects.
