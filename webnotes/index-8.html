<li>Use your children as a shield</li>
<li>I was afraid to pursue it.</li>
<li>If only I had</li>
<li>Unless</li>
</ul>
<p>I watched this because a friend recommend this to me. This has nothing new to
offer. Cut out the rhetoric and it didn't said a lot of either. It mainly
summarized the "excuses" people give on why they failed to have a "great
career". They fear they aren't lucky enough, they fear coming out as weird to
others, they say "nice and normal people don't passion". And then he says
people use children as shield and don't work hard.</p>
<p>Saying overcome your fear doesn't make you overcome it, Why have a "great"
career at all? People do fuck up relationships for accomplishment, people do
have to take care of their familes and kids and their are real constraints
because of them. It also doesn't define what is a great career and what does it
look like.</p>
<p>I find zero or rather negative value in this kinds of talk. It provides no
solutions nor does it provide any clarity or new insights on the problem. All
it does is to make people without "great careers" feel like lazy blob and it
provides people with "great career" a kind of entitlement making them feel like
they "deserved" it and they are somehow above those without a "great career".</p>
<!-- First of all it doesn't define what is great career, -->
<p>Luck <strong>is</strong> is a factor which decides who will have a "great career", rather I
should say privilege is a great deciding factor, ofcouse not to say it is the
only factor. Because luck or randomness is a factor doesn't mean you cannot
improve your chances, but this talk gives no insight on that.</p>
<p>Then there are real constraints in making a great career, one of the reason of
the glass ceiling is kids and the fact they have to work dabble shift, one at
the office and other at home. Then there are people for whom there is really a
very little margin of error and people who don't have strong backgrounds and
people who don't have a great support structure. The risk taking ability of
someone is often because of the external factors rather than the internals.</p>
<p>If it encourages and motivates that's great, but if you say it is your fault
that you are not pursuing your passion, then fuck off.</p>
<p>Sometimes people trying to purse their passions</p>
<p>Careerism??</p>
<p>fuck it I don't feel like writing.</p>

        <a href="normailization_of_deviation.html"><h2>Normalization of Deviation</h2>
        </a>
        <div>
<p>This was a pretty well written post about how very messed up practices end up
normalized. The answer is a weird combinatin of over optimism, rationalization
and adaption. And when a messed up practice gets normalized it is very hard to
see what's wrong with it.</p>
<p>A very simply solution that Atul Gawande talked about in the Checklist
Manifesto is to have a checklist. In the book he compared the medical sector
and infrastucture/construction sector. Both fields are immensely complex but
medicial practitioners often end up making terrible mistakes, which includes
cases like the one where a surgen forgot her equipment in the patient, where as
in construction error which have any harm to human life are very very rare.</p>
<p>But you don't have checklist for every small thing, and Atul provided a
guideline to making checklist, I don't clearly remember and I should go and
read the sections of the book again.</p>
<p>Checklists are useful because they end up freeing your mind from the
unnecessary boring detail. there are also other cases I can think of</p>
<p>Where to apply a rule:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Where the rewards or looses of doing something occur only in long term, we
tend to ignore the long term result and focus on instant gratification.</li>
<li>Always and never rules</li>
<li>The projects the complete counts and not the one you start.</li>
</ul>
<p>Formalization leads to gramatization, when a formal structure is in place it is
harder see things in informal terms or whatever that doesn't fall into that
formal structure tends to get ignored. A very clear example will be case where
peolple who have only learned about information transfer uses of language tend
find phatic usuages like that of small talk "useless".  But as it evident from
the use of term phatic, the way we with problems of formalization is more
formalization trying to capture things which weren't captured earlier, ofcourse
that formalization also leaves something. But as it said in Statistics, all
models are false but some are useful.</p>

        <p>We are young, energetic and ambitious but impatient. We want to "successful",
fast. Success is defined relative to the "success" of our peers which gives a
feeling that if we are not rushing things we are "falling behind". In our
definition success is a race. When you are running a race you can't stop to see
if this race is something worth running for. In the "race of life" everybody is
a looser. I think I can also say "in any race of life everybody is a looser".</p>

<p>Recently American Presidential candidate Donal Trump called out for a total ban on Muslim immigration to America. It is great to see that Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, came out and spoke against it. I totally support his statement that people him, people who are privileged should speak up for people who are not so privileged and whose voices are often not included in the debate.</p>

        </a>
        <p>I pretty much agree with Aaron here. Why am I still doing programming? Because
the programming I do is easy and it gets paid well and it is very uncomfortable
to move to newer areas, especially because they involve a lot of uncertaintly.
But do I want to do programming for life? Programming is great and powerful
tool but programming as end of things is not something that I want. I can learn
the new skills with time, I guess this time it is important that I don't take
pure programming jobs, or else it will become harder and harded to come out of
comfort zone. Take computational social science or ethics or civics intern and
more policy and social issue and please keep writing and share your writings.
You'll be misrepresented/misunderstood a few times, but its okay thats the way
you'll learn.</p>
