        </a>
        <div>
<p>This was a pretty well written post about how very messed up practices end up
normalized. The answer is a weird combinatin of over optimism, rationalization
and adaption. And when a messed up practice gets normalized it is very hard to
see what's wrong with it.</p>
<p>A very simply solution that Atul Gawande talked about in the Checklist
Manifesto is to have a checklist. In the book he compared the medical sector
and infrastucture/construction sector. Both fields are immensely complex but
medicial practitioners often end up making terrible mistakes, which includes
cases like the one where a surgen forgot her equipment in the patient, where as
in construction error which have any harm to human life are very very rare.</p>
<p>But you don't have checklist for every small thing, and Atul provided a
guideline to making checklist, I don't clearly remember and I should go and
read the sections of the book again.</p>
<p>Checklists are useful because they end up freeing your mind from the
unnecessary boring detail. there are also other cases I can think of</p>
<p>Where to apply a rule:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Where the rewards or looses of doing something occur only in long term, we
tend to ignore the long term result and focus on instant gratification.</li>
<li>Always and never rules</li>
<li>The projects the complete counts and not the one you start.</li>
</ul>
<p>Formalization leads to gramatization, when a formal structure is in place it is
harder see things in informal terms or whatever that doesn't fall into that
formal structure tends to get ignored. A very clear example will be case where
peolple who have only learned about information transfer uses of language tend
find phatic usuages like that of small talk "useless".  But as it evident from
the use of term phatic, the way we with problems of formalization is more
formalization trying to capture things which weren't captured earlier, ofcourse
that formalization also leaves something. But as it said in Statistics, all
models are false but some are useful.</p>

        </a>
        <p>We are young, energetic and ambitious but impatient. We want to "successful",
fast. Success is defined relative to the "success" of our peers which gives a
feeling that if we are not rushing things we are "falling behind". In our
definition success is a race. When you are running a race you can't stop to see
if this race is something worth running for. In the "race of life" everybody is
a looser. I think I can also say "in any race of life everybody is a looser".</p>

<p>Recently American Presidential candidate Donal Trump called out for a total ban on Muslim immigration to America. It is great to see that Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, came out and spoke against it. I totally support his statement that people him, people who are privileged should speak up for people who are not so privileged and whose voices are often not included in the debate.</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<p>First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out because I was
not a Socialist.</p>
<p>Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out because I
was not a Trade Unionist.</p>
<p>Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out because I was not a
Jew.</p>
<p>Then they came for me and there was no one left to speak for me.</p>

        </a>
        <p>I pretty much agree with Aaron here. Why am I still doing programming? Because
the programming I do is easy and it gets paid well and it is very uncomfortable
to move to newer areas, especially because they involve a lot of uncertaintly.
But do I want to do programming for life? Programming is great and powerful
tool but programming as end of things is not something that I want. I can learn
the new skills with time, I guess this time it is important that I don't take
pure programming jobs, or else it will become harder and harded to come out of
comfort zone. Take computational social science or ethics or civics intern and
more policy and social issue and please keep writing and share your writings.
You'll be misrepresented/misunderstood a few times, but its okay thats the way
you'll learn.</p>
