<p>K'Naan is amazing, I learned about him, when everybody learned about him during
the 2010 FIFA world cup. A remix of his Wavin' Flag was selected as the theme
song for the world cup. It was happy, fun and energetic song but when I
listened to the original version of the song I was awestruck, the song tells a
powerful story of people of Somalia and their struggle, the remix had nothing
of it. The two talks about totally different freedoms, one is "freedom and
fire" to rock the football field other is the freedom to live. I was discussing
this with a friend last night and listened more of his older songs and newer
songs. The older songs were deep and very personal telling one or the other
tales of the civil wars and its autocracies. Newer songs were much more
Americanized and in a sense they lacked substance.</p>
<p>I was happy to see that K'naan himself recognized this fact and wrote about it.
He writes:</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<p>Over breakfast in SoHo, we talked about how to keep my new American audience
growing. My lyrics should change, my label’s executives said; radio
programmers avoid subjects too far from fun and self-absorption.
And for the first time, I felt the affliction of success. When I walked away
from the table, there were bruises on the unheard lyrics of my yet-to-be-born
songs. A question had raised its hand in the quiet of my soul: What do you do
after success? What must you do to keep it?</p>
<p>If this was censorship, I thought, it was a new kind — one I had to do to
myself. The label wasn’t telling me what to do. No, it was just giving me
choices and information, about my audience — 15-year-old American girls,
mostly, who knew little of Somalia. How much better to sing them songs about
Americans.</p>
