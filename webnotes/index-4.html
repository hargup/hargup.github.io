<p>Steven Holden a PSF board member writes about the question which industry often
asks "What's in for Me?" when it comes to contributing to Open Source. And he
tries to argue that this should be a question at all because money shouldn't be
only thing that matters.</p>
<p>In recent years I have also developed deep skepticism and kinda disgust for the
big corporate and their mentality that profit justifies everything. And the
sadder part is that a lot of commoners have also justfied this idea. This
argument of "it sells" comes from everything from sexism in video games and
advertising to privacy issues and the copyright laws.</p>
<p>Hundereds of startups are booming up from Scilicon Valley to Bangalore it would
be interesting to analyze how many of them wouldn't even have the scope of
coming up if they didn't have all these open source tools and languages. Open
Source has given them so much yet they ask "What's in for me?"</p>

        </a>
        <p>In 1970's the number of women was low(10-15%) in every field, be in law,
medicine, computer science and physical sciences. The numbers have been
increasing steadily till date except for computer science, till 85 it was was
something around 30% and then it started decreasing. Now computer science has
less than 20% women and whereas other field have achieved near perfect gender
equality in terms of percentage of women enrolled. What went wrong? According
to the author, 80s saw a release of series of SciFi movies with a geeky male
protaganist. At that time computers were only toys and they bought only for
boys. We got our norm, men are geeky women are not and there by we got the
diversity problem in tech.</p>

        <a href="two_years_without_facebook.html"><h2>Two Years without Facebook</h2>
        </a>
        <div>
<p>I stumbled upon this blog post by Guru Prasad, where he describes spending two
years without Facebook. He did it for privacy reasons and because Facebook is
collecting way too much information than they should. He is also annoyed by the
fact that Facebook is not as much a medium to stay in touch but a stream of
photos and shares choosen by the algorithm of Facebook often to sell you
targeted ads.</p>
<p>I also tried such experiment last to last year, but that for two weeks not two
years. And no one will care if you are there or not, most of the people won't
even notice your absence. I also hate the fact that facebook track your every
mouse gesture your every moment you spend on their website. I definitely don't
mean to say that social media is evil phenomenon but that doesn't mean
everything is good about them and I want to take the bad parts out. For the
similar privacy/power balance reasons I want to move away from Google services.
I already use DuckDuckGo for search and I've also diched Google Chrome for
firefox. I'll try to spend some time this winter finding alternatives to gmail
and how I can move away from it.</p>
<p>I'm not diching Facebook yet, but I guess I can partially mitigate its bad
parts. One of to do it would probably be using a command line client for
facebook in which I choose who's posts and shares I subscribe to. I don't know
if anyone has done it yet, but I think that should be possible given the api by
facebook. Maybe I can also use elinks?</p>

        <a href="anita_s_and_liana_k.html"><h2>Anita Sarkeesian and Liana K</h2>
        </a>
        <div>
<p>Today I recommended Anita Sarkeesian's "Tropes vs Women in Video Games" to a
friend and realized that there is a new video in her playlist. It was about the
"Women as Reward" trope, where women's bodies or their sexual attention is
integrated in the game mechanics to act as rewards for players. Examples of
these are cases where players get rewards for having sex with other Non
Playable characters or get a smooch of victory or a sex of victory as a reward.
Anita's video was eductional as ever a more pleasant experience was watching a
video by Liana K.</p>
<p>So when I first watched Anita Sarkeesian last year I could see a video titled
"A female game developer's response to Anita Sarkeesian" in suggestions. Though
there were some valid points in many of Anita's responses a lot of it was plain
Ad hominem, because just because a woman says it doesn't make it right. This
time I watched one of her video and I was pleased because she was actually
trying to have a conversation, she posted a video where she reviewed the series
she the series of videos she made and there she thanked Anita Sarkeesian for
starting this dialogue on women in video games even though she disagreed with
her. That's amazing. She was trying to bridge a gap and people actually
listened, at least many of them. She didn't call things like "this is pro
gamer", "this is anti gamer" but it was like "here I disagree", "here I don't".
She also called on the reaction by some people that just because she, a woman,
disagreed with Anita Sarkeesian all women disagree with Anita. She clearly
called it out sexism and plain generalization because she does not represent
her gender and can have individual independent thoughts.</p>
<p>She is kinda inspiration and an example that "poles" can be brought close and
bridges can be built. And I think this should point to the lesson that it is
good to express your opinion, you can wrong or misinformed but if you are open
minded and respectful, then can opinion can lead to a conversion which can lead
to be better understanding for all.</p>
