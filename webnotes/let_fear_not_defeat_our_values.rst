Recently American Presidential candidate Donal Trump called out for a total ban on Muslim immigration to America. It is great to see that Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, come out and speak against it. I totally support his statement that people like him, people who are privileged should speak up for people who are not so privileged because whose voices are often not included in the debate.


.. epigraph::
    First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out because I was
    not a Socialist.

    Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out because I
    was not a Trade Unionist.

    Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out because I was not a
    Jew.

    Then they came for me and there was no one left to speak for me.
