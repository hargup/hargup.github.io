<p>This a very interesting discussion about GPL law suits and GPL enforcement. The
main point of debate is whether to use law suits to enforce GPL or not. Both of
the parties agree that having upstream contributions and user freedoms are
important but disagree about the particular methods to pursue that goal. The
side which pushes for law suits or threats argue that otherwise companies won't
comply, we don't get the code back and users loose on freedom. The other side
argues that law suits or their threats turn companies into law suits turn
companies into enemies. They are less likely to coorperate, meaning worse
software. Instead the way should be through internal negotiations, and changing
the culture from inside, companies eventually do contribute upstream they also
benifit from it and also because the law requires them to.</p>
<p>My personal opinion is that GPL is important, and the possibility of existance
of a law suit. If a company is going very antagonistic there needs to be a law
suits because otherwise when the companies know that no one realistic change of
law suit then GPL is powerless. Stallman himself gave examples of cases where
they were able to get GPL compliance simply about asking companies to do and
telling them that they are legally required to do so. So to me the question is
really about threshold, not the fact that they should be law suit or not,</p>
<p>Anyway as Linus says it is often easier to change things by working with your
opponents rathan working against them but against them should appear like a
realistic senario when things don't work out.</p>

    <p>This was a fascinating piece about Streetlight Effect and using it a as
metaphor to describe knowledge and ignorance. The really interesting bit was
where author described totalitarianism as something where there is only one
view point be it of boilerplate Marxism or free market capitalism or anything.
The totalitarian view point assumes that their framework can explain it all and
everything else. Totalitarianism is the like the streetlight where you try to
find all your answers but they don't exist there. The opposite of
totalitarianism isn't another view point but darkness where good and bad aren't
well defined and where the difference of between truth and false is not known.</p>

<p>&gt; You can win in two ways: you can research something that helps somebody beat
&gt; somebody else up or consume more, so that they give you funding. Or you can win
&gt; by not losing, by pulling some wild theoretical stunt that puts you out of
&gt; range of everybody else so that they can’t come after you. You become good at
&gt; critiquing things in ways that sound smart, and tell people who disagree with
&gt; you that they haven’t read your cannon. You hope that if they call your bluff
&gt; and read it, they will be so converted by the experience that they will leave
&gt; you alone.</p>
<p>This para drives home the point at so many levels. This is also something I
need to be really careful while doing inter disciplinary research. Being from
computational sciences I can use tools which no one in the humanities area
understand and it will be trying to answer questions which no one in the area
of the computational science cares about. So you'll be virtually unbeatable,
which is a really bad place to be in.</p>
<p>Keeping your research in open and helping access it as much as possible not
only increases the value of your research but also gives a proof that what you
are working on is something somebody cares about.</p>

    <p>This was a very interesting analysis by PhilGoetz how "reason" can be thought
of a memetic immune disorder. The idea is that people have lot of belives which
might come from religion or tradition or culture. Since belives are often very
general, they might not generalize well. In a situtation where live with that
belive for a long time with people who's behaviour are based on similar belives
you learn socially which parts of belives to follow and which you shouldn't.
When some one tries to reason out those belives they loose the immunity they
loose the immunity they have gained from the herd and try to apply the rules
where where they shouldn't be used. EY puts is pretty well "rationality (is) a
failure of compartmentalization - the attempt to take everything you hear
seriously."</p>

<p>There are two lessons I take out of this story:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Promote Free Software, Free as in Free Speech, rather mandate their use in
such cases. Even Free Software can also be biased but in case of non free
software it can become practically impossible to find their biases and
correct them.</li>
<li>We as should selling algorithms as magic, instead of saying there is 60
likelihood that person X will commit the crime again, say according to my
system the person X is sixty percent similar to other people who commit the
crime again with my rather transparent definition of similarity. Ram and
Rahim are brother, as brothers of course they are similar at many levels,
Ram has commited a crime does that mean Rahim will do it too?</li>
