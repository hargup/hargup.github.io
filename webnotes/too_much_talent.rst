.. title: The Surprising Problem of Too Much Talent
.. date: Tuesday 08 December 2015 04:12:55 PM IST

The study from some sports suggests that add more talented people decreases the
overall team performance probably due to decreased coversion in the team. I
guess the problem is more because of hiring assholes rather than hiring talent.
People skills and physical/sports/domain ability often don't come together.
And as suggested by _<stegasourous strategy>, in some areas assholery appears
more clever (say talented).
