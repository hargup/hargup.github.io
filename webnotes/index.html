<p>We are relying more and more on algorithms for making decisions for us but
often they are designed for the "average" and people who are not in the
"average" are left out. Here the "average" often means the elite or people who
are already in power and control things. There have numerous cases of implicit
sexism and racisim "by technology" [1] [2]. When designing technology we need
to careful of whom we include but also who we exclude.</p>

        <a href="the_real_reason_why_you_are_distracted.html"><h2>The real reason why you are distracted</h2>
        </a>
        <div>
<p>In this video essay Adam Westbrook tries to reason out why our generation so
distracted. He gave two to three arguments which really didn't fit in. He first
told media and scientist are blaming the new technology which keeps us so
distracted. It is the internet and the computers now, in 80s people blamed the
distraction on TVs and 40 on radios and even earlier on movies. And the classic
example where Socrates said that writing will bring forgetfulness in people's
sole. I keep hearing this argument all the time and it is often used to say
"You older generation you have always feared the new technology will bring
distraction and have always been wrong and you are also wrong this time". This
is sometime also accompanied by a picture of a lot of people reading newspaper in
a bus and no one talking to one another. This argument I feel is very shallow,
just because transition from one technology to another didn't causes people to
become more "distracted" doesn't mean this upcoming transition won't or isn't
doing the same. There is also an implicit assumption that the earlier
transition didn't bring more "distraction" and as I said a belief the older
generation is seeing the whole technology as bad. I like to see things the way
Walter O. Jong described in his book Orality and Literacy, that Literacy didn't
just "upgraded" orality, it completely changed who we are, we gained a lot but
we also lost somethings and literacy even changed the definition of what we
consider as gain and what as loss. I sincerely believe that internet is one
awesome invention by humans but there are things we need to fix about it, soon.</p>
<p>Well in the beginning of the essay Adam talked about Mozzart and his amazing
concentration. I don't see how it made sense. He took a single example out of
time and context and just threw it.</p>
<p>In the middle of the essay he talked about the role of hyperlinks in
distraction, every hyperlink is a decision, to click or not click. Often when
on the internet you just keep browsing through the hyperlinks, one link to the
another, forgetting where you came from and why. I enjoy doing it and sometimes
I stumble upon very interesting content this way but of course this is not a
good to get things done, and to learn something deeply and thoroughly. And I
think I should do this random browsing less often, but it is not something evil
that I should not do at all.</p>
<p>In the end he pointed out that many of the internet companies makes their
profit from advertisements and it makes sense for them to keep us distracted,
because the more pages we visit the more ads we see, a distracted person will
visit more pages in unit time so more profit made. A more distracted population
also makes sense for totalitarian governments and big cooperates because a more
distracted population is less likely to notice their autocracies and is less
likely to protest. A distracted population is a population which is easier to
control. By the way a very problematic aspect of online advertisement is cross
website tracking and surveillance. We seriously need to take a stand against
it. If you have not done it already I highly recommend that you watch the
interactive documentary "Do Not Track Us" <a class="reference external" href="https://donottrack-doc.com/en/">https://donottrack-doc.com/en/</a>.</p>

        </a>
        <div>
<p>This is a rebuttal of Paul Graham's essay "Let the 95% in", where PG argues to
easing the immigration laws so that tech companies can get more programmers
from outside the US. Tough I and also the author sympathesis with the
conclusion, PG has got all the arguments wrong.</p>
<p>When I first read PG's essay I liked it and I was "yup, this guy is making
sense" and now he doesn't. This tells me that I need to think more carefully
about the things I read and thing which forms my opinion. And need to include
more opposing sources of information in my reading. Its like when I first read
PG many years ago I liked him and then I read a lot of him and I felt
everything he writes is so true. Which is almost impossible for anyone? Well
why do I think so? Okay, no meta thoughts for now.</p>

        </a>
        <div>
<p>This article shared an interesting and a very positive perspective on Nehru,
the first Prime Minister of India. He was inconsistent without disagreement. Our
present government says it is pro development, against development nothing
matter and especially secularism should go to the dump. Nehru was a person who
things as a whole, he recognized that scientific and industrial development is
important to gain power but he also understood these are not the only thing we
need to have. Our people need to have a depth of personality and sense of
tolerance to see that they are not the only people who are right. Nehru was
against dogma, including the dogma of science.</p>
<p>I saw a post where Nehru was being criticized for his Hindu rate of growth and
that was the only thing mentioned about him. But other factors about Nehru
often gets ignore, the time when Nehru took the lead of the Nation, it was in a
utter state of Chaos. India is a country where people can be divided in
thousands of different groups, be it by caste, religion or language. The fact
that he managed to keep the Nation One I think is an achievement in itself.</p>

        </a>
        <p>Academia has a problem of Assholes, people who belittle other people, bash for
not knowing something etc. In this article the author discuss what promotes
people to behave as assholes. She talks about the book ‘The No Asshole Rule’
Robert Sutton, where he discuss why having a asshole in your organization is
bad and in the last chapter he tries to answer the question "Is there any
advantage of being an asshole?", it turns out that unkind behavior is seen as
unlikeable but is seen as more clever and intelligent and this is what promotes
assholes in Academia. I want to Sutton's book, it appears to be a very
interesting read, I also skimmed through his blog a few days and he appeared
insightful.</p>
