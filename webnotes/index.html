        </a>
        <p>A few weeks ago our prime minister Narendra Modi visited UK and a he was "not
welcomed" there, at least by some of the people. An image of Modi with a sword
in one hand and Om in background convering to Swastika symbolized that Modi is
equivalent to Hitler. The author aptly said that such method to counter Hindu
communalism aren't only outright offensive but also counter productive. The
point is to attack Hindu Communalism not to attack Hindus. Author suggested
that a better approach will be trying to evoke the spirit of tolerance and
inclusiveness found in Vedic Hindism.</p>

        </a>
        <div>
<p>UK Government is trying to push a which will force internet and phone companies
to store the all the data for 12 months. Indian government also pushed a draft
of similar encryption policy a few months where everyone was required to store
the plaintext of all the encryptions for 90 days. Probably UK and US government
have laws where I can be arrested for being a terrorist "sympathizer" and I
also heard a statement from David Cameroon that he wants to curb "non violent
extremists". Tell me how is being a "extremist" here. Governments are simply
creating Fear, Uncertainly and Doubt to control more and more aspects of our
lives.</p>
<p>I'm hundred, maybe even thousand time more likely to die in a car crash than in
a attack like that of Paris of Mumbai. Which party has its agenda, "we need to
make safer cars", "we need to stop rash driving", "we need to force companies
to make such a cars that can never kill anybody."</p>

        <a href="k_naan_censoring_myself_for_sucess.html"><h2>K'Naan of censoring himself for Success</h2>
        </a>
        <div>
<p>K'Naan is amazing, I learned about him, when everybody learned about him during
the 2010 FIFA world cup. A remix of his Wavin' Flag was selected as the theme
song for the world cup. It was happy, fun and energetic song but when I
listened to the original version of the song I was awestruck, the song tells a
powerful story of people of Somalia and their struggle, the remix had nothing
of it. The two talks about totally different freedoms, one is "freedom and
fire" to rock the football field other is the freedom to live. I was discussing
this with a friend last night and listened more of his older songs and newer
songs. The older songs were deep and very personal telling one or the other
tales of the civil wars and its autocracies. Newer songs were much more
Americanized and in a sense they lacked substance.</p>
<p>I was happy to see that K'naan himself recognized this fact and wrote about it.
He writes:</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<p>Over breakfast in SoHo, we talked about how to keep my new American audience
growing. My lyrics should change, my label’s executives said; radio
programmers avoid subjects too far from fun and self-absorption.
And for the first time, I felt the affliction of success. When I walked away
from the table, there were bruises on the unheard lyrics of my yet-to-be-born
songs. A question had raised its hand in the quiet of my soul: What do you do
after success? What must you do to keep it?</p>
<p>If this was censorship, I thought, it was a new kind — one I had to do to
myself. The label wasn’t telling me what to do. No, it was just giving me
choices and information, about my audience — 15-year-old American girls,
mostly, who knew little of Somalia. How much better to sing them songs about
Americans.</p>
