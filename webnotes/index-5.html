<p>This article shared an interesting and a very positive perspective on Nehru,
the first Prime Minister of India. He was inconsistent without disagreement. Our
present government says it is pro development, against development nothing
matter and especially secularism should go to the dump. Nehru was a person who
things as a whole, he recognized that scientific and industrial development is
important to gain power but he also understood these are not the only thing we
need to have. Our people need to have a depth of personality and sense of
tolerance to see that they are not the only people who are right. Nehru was
against dogma, including the dogma of science.</p>
<p>I saw a post where Nehru was being criticized for his Hindu rate of growth and
that was the only thing mentioned about him. But other factors about Nehru
often gets ignore, the time when Nehru took the lead of the Nation, it was in a
utter state of Chaos. India is a country where people can be divided in
thousands of different groups, be it by caste, religion or language. The fact
that he managed to keep the Nation One I think is an achievement in itself.</p>

<p>We are relying more and more on algorithms for making decisions for us but
often they are designed for the "average" and people who are not in the
"average" are left out. Here the "average" often means the elite or people who
are already in power and control things. There have numerous cases of implicit
sexism and racisim "by technology" [1] [2]. When designing technology we need
to careful of whom we include but also who we exclude.</p>

<p>This is a rebuttal of Paul Graham's essay "Let the 95% in", where PG argues to
easing the immigration laws so that tech companies can get more programmers
from outside the US. Tough I and also the author sympathesis with the
conclusion, PG has got all the arguments wrong.</p>
<p>When I first read PG's essay I liked it and I was "yup, this guy is making
sense" and now he doesn't. This tells me that I need to think more carefully
about the things I read and thing which forms my opinion. And need to include
more opposing sources of information in my reading. Its like when I first read
PG many years ago I liked him and then I read a lot of him and I felt
everything he writes is so true. Which is almost impossible for anyone? Well
why do I think so? Okay, no meta thoughts for now.</p>

    <p>Academia has a problem of Assholes, people who belittle other people, bash for
not knowing something etc. In this article the author discuss what promotes
people to behave as assholes. She talks about the book ‘The No Asshole Rule’
Robert Sutton, where he discuss why having a asshole in your organization is
bad and in the last chapter he tries to answer the question "Is there any
advantage of being an asshole?", it turns out that unkind behavior is seen as
unlikeable but is seen as more clever and intelligent and this is what promotes
assholes in Academia. I want to Sutton's book, it appears to be a very
interesting read, I also skimmed through his blog a few days and he appeared
insightful.</p>

    <p>Academicians by their nature and training are critical, they are skeptic and
they are trained to see where things might go wrong. What can be faulty
assumption and what step doesn't really follow from the previous one. Facing
and embracing your criticism is important as it brings out hidden flaws and
helps you improve overall. This can be tough for people who are new to it. It
was touch for the author of this blog post, they have decried the events where
they have cried in the bathroom and though about quitting academia on their
forth day. But people eventually cope up with criticism and author describes
mainly two strategies people take. Some people internalize what critiques like
and what they don't and they do the things which they like and avoid the one
which they don't. They basically become a chameleon. Others develop a hard skin
and become stegosaurus. Stegosaurus spin their tail and argues back. Author
argues you should become neither of them, chameleon does things for the fear
and not for the love of it whereas stegosaurus in some sense becomes the bully
themselves. What will I do? I don't know a stegosaurus definitely seems better
than a chameleon</p>
