This para drives home the point at so many levels. This is also something I
need to be really careful while doing inter disciplinary research. Being from
computational sciences I can use tools which no one in the humanities area
understand and it will be trying to answer questions which no one in the area
of the computational science cares about. So you'll be virtually unbeatable,
which is a really bad place to be in.

Keeping your research in open and helping access it as much as possible not
only increases the value of your research but also gives a proof that what you
are working on is something somebody cares about.
