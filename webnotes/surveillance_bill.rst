UK Government is trying to push a which will force internet and phone companies
to store the all the data for 12 months. Indian government also pushed a draft
of similar encryption policy a few months where everyone was required to store
the plaintext of all the encryptions for 90 days. Probably UK and US government
have laws where I can be arrested for being a terrorist "sympathizer" and I
also heard a statement from David Cameroon that he wants to curb "non violent
extremists". Tell me how is being a "extremist" here. Governments are simply
creating Fear, Uncertainly and Doubt to control more and more aspects of our
lives.

I'm hundred, maybe even thousand time more likely to die in a car crash than in
a attack like that of Paris of Mumbai. Which party has its agenda, "we need to
make safer cars", "we need to stop rash driving", "we need to force companies
to make such a cars that can never kill anybody."
