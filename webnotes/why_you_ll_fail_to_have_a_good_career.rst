* Luck
* Genius

* Weird

* Nice normal people don't have passion

* Interest vs Passion

* Velcro vs UFT

* I value human relationships more than accomplishment

* Use your children as a shield

* I was afraid to pursue it.

* If only I had

* Unless

I watched this because a friend recommend this to me. This has nothing new to
offer. Cut out the rhetoric and it didn't said a lot of either. It mainly
summarized the "excuses" people give on why they failed to have a "great
career". They fear they aren't lucky enough, they fear coming out as weird to
others, they say "nice and normal people don't passion". And then he says
people use children as shield and don't work hard.

Saying overcome your fear doesn't make you overcome it, Why have a "great"
career at all? People do fuck up relationships for accomplishment, people do
have to take care of their familes and kids and their are real constraints
because of them. It also doesn't define what is a great career and what does it
look like.

I find zero or rather negative value in this kinds of talk. It provides no
solutions nor does it provide any clarity or new insights on the problem. All
it does is to make people without "great careers" feel like lazy blob and it
provides people with "great career" a kind of entitlement making them feel like
they "deserved" it and they are somehow above those without a "great career".

.. First of all it doesn't define what is great career, 

Luck **is** is a factor which decides who will have a "great career", rather I
should say privilege is a great deciding factor, ofcouse not to say it is the
only factor. Because luck or randomness is a factor doesn't mean you cannot
improve your chances, but this talk gives no insight on that.

Then there are real constraints in making a great career, one of the reason of
the glass ceiling is kids and the fact they have to work dabble shift, one at
the office and other at home. Then there are people for whom there is really a
very little margin of error and people who don't have strong backgrounds and
people who don't have a great support structure. The risk taking ability of
someone is often because of the external factors rather than the internals.

If it encourages and motivates that's great, but if you say it is your fault
that you are not pursuing your passion, then fuck off.

Sometimes people trying to purse their passions 

Careerism??

fuck it I don't feel like writing.

When some like this guy tells people from outside that
they are making excuses, how do you know they aren't.
