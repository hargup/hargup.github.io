Beware  of  the  person  who gives  advice,  telling you  that  a  certain
action on your part is “good for you” while it is also good for him, while the
harm to you doesn't directly affect him .


Salespeople  were  experts  in  the  art  of  psychological manipulation,
making the client trade, often against his ow n interest, while being happy
about it and loving them and their company

The Most Intolerant Wins: The Dominance of the Stubborn Minority
================================================================

* The Minority rule:
intransigent will dominate because of assymetry


To Read about:

* Re-normalization group


* Best worse-case divergence from expectation.

* Nobody was fired for contracting IBM.

* Another example is language assemtry

* How do books get banned? How to minority view rule the others.

* It is the most intolerant person who imposes virtue on the others precisely
    of that intolerance.

* The most motivated wins

* Value of courage.


# Rationality

* Avoiding the unccle point

* Regular arithmetic is good only for micro benefits and losses instead of
    macro ones.

* Situations with an absorbing state are very different from the one's without
    it.

* Taleb's argument present interesting argumenta. I should probably try to run
    a simulation for that.

* Take maximum risk in everything that does not entertain ruin condition,
but take max precaution in ones who does. -- Same applies to assumption of good
faith norms.

* Things that have repeated exposure should never be analyzed as a single
    event.

* Knowing too much without ability to eliminate junk degrades knowledge. -- My
    efforts at this should be solidifying current knowledge rather than
    absorbing more.

* Intellectual  and  ethical  freedom  requires the absence  of  the  skin  of  others in one’s game One-dimensional stochastic process always revisits.


# How to own people

* Conditioning and psycological manipulation
* Forcing people to have something significant to loose if they disobey
    authority.

* Compared to contractors, employees have a significant skin in the game.
    * By being employees, the employees signal certain kind of domestication.

* Today a person is employeed by the idea that (s)he needs to be employable.

* The best slave is someone you overpay and who know it.

* Traders and salespeople were only managable when they were unprofitable, in
    which case they weren't wanted.

* Foul Language as a signal of being free.

* You don't signal competence if you don't take risks for it.

* What matters isn't what a person has or doesn't have; it is what he or she is
    afraid of losing.

* It is easier to trust the word of an autocrat than a fragile elected
    official.

* When people have something to loose they loose courage.

* Disorder increases with dimentionality
