Academia has a problem of Assholes, people who belittle other people, bash for
not knowing something etc. In this article the author discuss what promotes
people to behave as assholes. She talks about the book ‘The No Asshole Rule’
Robert Sutton, where he discuss why having a asshole in your organization is
bad and in the last chapter he tries to answer the question "Is there any
advantage of being an asshole?", it turns out that unkind behavior is seen as
unlikeable but is seen as more clever and intelligent and this is what promotes
assholes in Academia. I want to Sutton's book, it appears to be a very
interesting read, I also skimmed through his blog a few days and he appeared
insightful.
