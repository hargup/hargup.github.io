In 1970's the number of women was low(10-15%) in every field, be in law,
medicine, computer science and physical sciences. The numbers have been
increasing steadily till date except for computer science, till 85 it was was
something around 30% and then it started decreasing. Now computer science has
less than 20% women and whereas other field have achieved near perfect gender
equality in terms of percentage of women enrolled. What went wrong? According
to the author, 80s saw a release of series of SciFi movies with a geeky male
protaganist. At that time computers were only toys and they bought only for
boys. We got our norm, men are geeky women are not and there by we got the
diversity problem in tech.
