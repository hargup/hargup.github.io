.. date: Tuesday 24 November 2015 06:58:50 PM IST

A few weeks ago our prime minister Narendra Modi visited UK and a he was "not
welcomed" there, at least by some of the people. An image of Modi with a sword
in one hand and Om in background convering to Swastika symbolized that Modi is
equivalent to Hitler. The author aptly said that such method to counter Hindu
communalism aren't only outright offensive but also counter productive. The
point is to attack Hindu Communalism not to attack Hindus. Author suggested
that a better approach will be trying to evoke the spirit of tolerance and
inclusiveness found in Vedic Hindism.
