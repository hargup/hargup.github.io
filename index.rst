I'm Harsh Gupta, a geek who is pretty much interested in everything. Lately
I've been exploring the intersection of law, technology and society. Everything
expressed here is entirely personal.

I have interened at `Center for Internet and Society India
<http://cis-india.org/>`_ and have helped create `Wikipedia Human Gender Indicators
<http://whgi.wmflabs.org/>`_. I'm also one of the founding members of `metaKGP
<https://wiki.metakgp.org>`_.
