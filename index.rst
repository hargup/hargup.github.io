I'm Harsh Gupta, a fifth year undergrad student at Indian Institute of Technology
Kharagpur majoring in Mathematics and Computing. I'm interested in
understanding how technology, specifically internet, affects society at
holistic level and then ultimately influencing its direction and impact.

Most recently I interened at `Center for Internet and Society India <http://cis-india.org/>`_ and
helped create `Wikipedia Human Gender Indicators <http://whgi.wmflabs.org/>`_. I'm also one of the
founding members of `metaKGP <https://wiki.metakgp.org>`_.
