.. title: Machine Bias

There are two lessons I take out of this story:

1. Promote Free Software, Free as in Free Speech, rather mandate their use in
   such cases. Even Free Software can also be biased but in case of non free
   software it can become practically impossible to find their biases and
   correct them.

2. We as should selling algorithms as magic, instead of saying there is 60
   likelihood that person X will commit the crime again, say according to my
   system the person X is sixty percent similar to other people who commit the
   crime again with my rather transparent definition of similarity. Ram and
   Rahim are brother, as brothers of course they are similar at many levels,
   Ram has commited a crime does that mean Rahim will do it too?
