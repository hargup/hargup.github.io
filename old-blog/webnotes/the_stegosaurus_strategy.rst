Academicians by their nature and training are critical, they are skeptic and
they are trained to see where things might go wrong. They need to think "What can be faulty
assumption and what step doesn't really follow from the previous one". Facing
and embracing your criticism is important as it brings out hidden flaws and
helps you improve overall. This can be tough for people who are new to it. It
was tough for the author of this blog post, they have decried the events where
they have cried in the bathroom and though about quitting academia on their
forth day. But people eventually cope up with criticism and author describes
mainly two strategies people take. Some people internalize what critiques like
and what they don't and they do the things which they like and avoid the one
which they don't. They basically become a chameleon. Others develop a hard skin
and become stegosaurus. Stegosaurus spin their tail and argues back. Author
argues you should become neither of them, chameleon does things for the fear
and not for the love of it whereas stegosaurus in some sense becomes the bully
themselves. What will I do? I don't know a stegosaurus definitely seems better
than a chameleon
