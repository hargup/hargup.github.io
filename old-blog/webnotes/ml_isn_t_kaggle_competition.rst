.. title: Machine Learning isn't Kaggle Competition

Kaggle is a machine learning contest platform, where the participants are given
a machine learning problem, a training dataset, an evaluation criterion and
they have to build the best model. But, while doing machine learning in
production these things comes much later, you have to first define the Business
Problem very clearly, determine if it is even a right ML problem or not. Get
the right data, clean it up, determine the right metrics, do a lot of
engineering part to put it in product and keep it running. The Kaggle
Competition part is much smaller and much less significant than people would
imagine.
