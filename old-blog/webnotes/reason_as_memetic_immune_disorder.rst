This was a very interesting analysis by PhilGoetz how "reason" can be thought
of a memetic immune disorder. The idea is that people have lot of belives which
might come from religion or tradition or culture. Since belives are often very
general, they might not generalize well. In a situtation where live with that
belive for a long time with people who's behaviour are based on similar belives
you learn socially which parts of belives to follow and which you shouldn't.
When some one tries to reason out those belives they loose the immunity they
loose the immunity they have gained from the herd and try to apply the rules
where where they shouldn't be used. EY puts is pretty well "rationality (is) a
failure of compartmentalization - the attempt to take everything you hear
seriously."
