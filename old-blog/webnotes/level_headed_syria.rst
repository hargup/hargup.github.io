Yonatan Zunger, tries to take a deeper look on the Paris attacks and why they
happened.

1.) The Europe is wildly unaccepting of Muslim population, often pass laws
which disrupts their lifestyle and see them as outsides even though they have
been living in there from two to three generations.

2.) Wild unemployment and lack of food security in Middle East which can be
linked directly to Climate Change and Global Warming.
