<p>We are relying more and more on algorithms for making decisions for us but
often they are designed for the "average" and people who are not in the
"average" are left out. Here the "average" often means the elite or people who
are already in power and control things. There have numerous cases of implicit
sexism and racisim "by technology" [1] [2]. When designing technology we need
to careful of whom we include but also who we exclude.</p>

<p>This is a rebuttal of Paul Graham's essay "Let the 95% in", where PG argues to
easing the immigration laws so that tech companies can get more programmers
from outside the US. Tough I and also the author sympathesis with the
conclusion, PG has got all the arguments wrong.</p>
<p>When I first read PG's essay I liked it and I was "yup, this guy is making
sense" and now he doesn't. This tells me that I need to think more carefully
about the things I read and thing which forms my opinion. And need to include
more opposing sources of information in my reading. Its like when I first read
PG many years ago I liked him and then I read a lot of him and I felt
everything he writes is so true. Which is almost impossible for anyone? Well
why do I think so? Okay, no meta thoughts for now.</p>

    <p>Academia has a problem of Assholes, people who belittle other people, bash for
not knowing something etc. In this article the author discuss what promotes
people to behave as assholes. She talks about the book ‘The No Asshole Rule’
Robert Sutton, where he discuss why having a asshole in your organization is
bad and in the last chapter he tries to answer the question "Is there any
advantage of being an asshole?", it turns out that unkind behavior is seen as
unlikeable but is seen as more clever and intelligent and this is what promotes
assholes in Academia. I want to Sutton's book, it appears to be a very
interesting read, I also skimmed through his blog a few days and he appeared
insightful.</p>

<p>Steven Holden a PSF board member writes about the question which industry often
asks "What's in for Me?" when it comes to contributing to Open Source. And he
tries to argue that this should be a question at all because money shouldn't be
only thing that matters.</p>
<p>In recent years I have also developed deep skepticism and kinda disgust for the
big corporate and their mentality that profit justifies everything. And the
sadder part is that a lot of commoners have also justfied this idea. This
argument of "it sells" comes from everything from sexism in video games and
advertising to privacy issues and the copyright laws.</p>
<p>Hundereds of startups are booming up from Scilicon Valley to Bangalore it would
be interesting to analyze how many of them wouldn't even have the scope of
coming up if they didn't have all these open source tools and languages. Open
Source has given them so much yet they ask "What's in for me?"</p>

    <p>Academicians by their nature and training are critical, they are skeptic and
they are trained to see where things might go wrong. They need to think "What can be faulty
assumption and what step doesn't really follow from the previous one". Facing
and embracing your criticism is important as it brings out hidden flaws and
helps you improve overall. This can be tough for people who are new to it. It
was tough for the author of this blog post, they have decried the events where
they have cried in the bathroom and though about quitting academia on their
forth day. But people eventually cope up with criticism and author describes
mainly two strategies people take. Some people internalize what critiques like
and what they don't and they do the things which they like and avoid the one
which they don't. They basically become a chameleon. Others develop a hard skin
and become stegosaurus. Stegosaurus spin their tail and argues back. Author
argues you should become neither of them, chameleon does things for the fear
and not for the love of it whereas stegosaurus in some sense becomes the bully
themselves. What will I do? I don't know a stegosaurus definitely seems better
than a chameleon</p>
