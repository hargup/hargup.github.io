<h2>Measuring Chilling Effect</h2>
<p>Last semester I took a course on Copyright last year and one of the most
important that I think that I've learned is that anything can be legal and
anything can be illegal, depending on how argue about it. But not every
position cannot be argued equally and</p>
<p>There are two interesting questions here:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Does the economic power of economic power of the plaintiff influence the
   decisions of the court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decision in favour of one position makes it easier to argue in favor of that
   position again, assuming the positions of the powerful plaintiff doesn't
   change then we should see a constant drift of the position, otherwise the
   drift to the other position is lead by a powerful entity to have its stake
   on the other side. So the interesting question to ask here, in how many
   cases when there is a shift in the position of the court,</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>how many of them
   were lead by a powerful entity on the other side.</p>
<h2>Effect of Network on Inclusively</h2>
<p>Open communities are very prone to being homogenious. There are less than 5 %
women in Open Source and a typical wikipedia editor is a white male. I feel a
very important factor for this homogenety is network effect. I came into open
source because I knew people who contribute to FOSS, many of my friends have
come into, I belive, through my influence. Another anecdotal example will be
that two years ago I did GSoC in Sympy, the next year there were two folks from
IIT KGP and this year almost half the GSoC participants in SymPy were KGPians.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does one being friend of a person involved in a free and open community
    increases their chances of participating in the community?</li>
</ul>
<p>This kind of research might also support programs like Outreachy which are
supposed to set up the initial "attractors" in the not so represented
communities to set up an initial base in the not so well represented
communities.</p>
<p>Maybe write to Stephnie and ask them to collect information about how did they
come to hear about GSoC and the organization they participated in</p>
<ul>
<li>Poster, news article, college event, previous GSoC -- for the first question</li>
</ul>
<p>What was your first introduction to the organiztion you participated in.
* previous user, ideas list, previous GSoCers</p>
<h2>Universal file convertor</h2>
<h2>Repository of Open Research Questions</h2>
<p>Why is it not here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Researcher are protective of their ideas</li>
<li>It is hard to pose a problem well</li>
<li>They grow too used to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are hell lot of people looking for interesting things to do with their
skills</p>
<p>It is hard to do any proper research in one year.</p>
