..     These traits — the ability to show off one’s knowledge, to argue over fine
..     (and possibly trivial) points, to correct others publicly — aren’t
..     inherently male or female. Still, they’re often beneficial for men and
..     socially detrimental for women. On the Internet, this shouldn’t matter. No
..     one can see you, and with the right screen name, gender is all but
..     impossible to detect. And, of course, there are tons of women on the Web.
..     But after a lifetime of hearing that they should be polite,
..     non–confrontational and self–deprecating, many women may feel uncomfortable
..     shedding that training to engage in a toad classification debate on
..     Wikipedia.

..     All programmers are optimists. Perhaps this modern sorcery attracts only those
..     who believe in happy endings and fairy godmothers.
..
..     -- Frederick Brooke, The Mythical Man-Month


.. epigraph::
    Theorist invents his companions, as a naive Romeo imagining hi ideal Juliet.
    The experimenter's lovers sweat, complain and fart.
